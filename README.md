# Property-Rent-SQL-Database
In this project I create the MySQL Database of company that rent property. I create a few tables and with help of basic queries I get information about property that company manage. After that I connect MySQL to PowerBi to show data. I create Dashbord for Rent Manager to get most valuable data about Company like revenue or number of property are in the Company database. In feature time I want to develop this project in something bigger, for example add Python as a backend and expand the database


### 1. Create Tables in MySQL
### 2. Insert Data in MySQL 
### 3. SQL Queries
### 4. Export Data to CSV from SQL Queries
### 5. Connect MySQL in to Power BI
### 6. Create Dashboard for Rent Manager
